\begin{abstract}
The hole theory of supeconductivity was first presented by Hirch and Marsiglio in 1989\cite{hirschfirsthole} as an attempt to explain the mechanism for superconductivity in the, then recently discovered, high temperature superconductors.  In the ensuing twenty-five years, that seminal first article has been cited 191 times and, Hirsch has continued to develop the theory and now posits it as a viable explanation for superconductivity in all superconducting materials.  The proposed research is a series of experimental tests of the theory.  Each of the tests however, will also produce data for previously uncharacterized parameters and dynamic behaviors of bulk superconductors.

\section{Introduction: What and Why 2/3 of a page}
\textbf{Clearly state what you intend to do in this manuscript:}
\\
The example first clearly states that the proposed research is urgently needed.  It then states why the existing research does not meet the bar.  After doing both these things, it adds the sentence, "The purpose of this research project is to..."
\\
\\
The chain of logic behind the theory of hole superconductivity follows 
\\
\\
1.  The charged particles forming the paired super-current carriers are in fact holes and not electrons.
\\
\\
2.  As the supercondcutor cools, holes pair and their wavelenghts expand corresponding to larger atomic radii.  A convenient model for this behavior can be found in the covalent bond of $H_2$.
\\
\\
3.  In order to provide perfect diamagnetism, the orbital radii associated with the kinetic energy lowering of the holes are equal to the London penetration depth.
\\
\\
4.  These radii are so large that it is energetically favorable for the paired holes have to align their phases creating coherency on a macroscopic level across the entire superconducting sample.
\\
\\
5.  Add something about how paris are predicted to be completely destroyed by quenching???
\\
\\
Add a brief explanation of the predictions of the theory.  Here's a question for Dr. Agnolet.  What should an introduction include?  Obviously it can't go too deeply into the theory or it won't be an introductin anymore.  Lok at Andrew's introduction again.
\\
\\
next:  add a few sentences saying what will be discussed in this proposal.
\\
\\
In addition to testing the experimental limits of the hole theory of superconductivity, the proposed research will provide new data for the following four characterizations of superconductor behavior.
\\
1.  The triboelectric effect with regard to sueprconductors.  Hirsch's theory predicts that samples in the superconducting state should fall near the end of the triboelectric scale.  He also points out that there have been no measurements made of the triboelectric properties of superconductors. NOTE: cite Hirsch's paper and the latest PRL triboelectric research.
\\
\\
2.  The presence or absence of electric fields within superconductors.
\\
Hirsch points out\cite{Hirschcap} that while Heinrich London performed an initial experiment on the existance of electric fields within superconductors\cite{londoncap} which returned a null result (todo: add citation), the experiment has never been replicated or refined.  
\\
\\
3.  Determine the mean inner potential of the constiuent atoms of materials in their superconducing state\cite{hirschdifraction}.  The theory of hole superconductivity predicts that the outer orbital of superocnducting atoms should exapd to a radius equal to the London penetration depth for the given material.  This expansion should be visable in electron diffraction measurements.  
\\
\\
4.  Characterization of the photonic radiation from superocnductors when they are quenched.
\\
Each of these characaterizations will be performed for both high termperature and conventional superconducting samples.  The data sets produced are listed in finer detail in the following table.
\\
The purpose of the proposed research is to experimentally test two of the predictions made by the hole theory of superconductivity, that quenched superconductors emit ionizing radiation and that electron diffraction should reveal an increased atomic mean potential due to the expanded outer orbitals of the superconducting atoms.

\section{Review of the Hole Theory of Superconductivity 3 pages at most}
\textbf{Spin and orbital velocity}
\\
There are two different velocties to keeep tracak of in the hole theory of superconductivity  The first is the spin velocity of the supercarriers in their expanded atomic orbitals it is given in terms of angular momentum\cite{hirschspinvel} as
\\
$L = m_e v_\sigma^0 \left(2 \lambda_L\right) = \dfrac{\hbar}{2}$
\\
which gives an intial spin velocity of 
\\
$v_\sigma^0 = \dfrac{\hbar}{4 m_e \lambda_L}$
\\
Note that the spin velocity is independent of the size of the sample and only depends on the London penetraation depth of the material.  This falls out naturally from the derivation above where it was shown that perfrect Larmor diamagnetism implies an expanded supercarrier orbital proportional to the London penetration depth of the material.
\\
\\
This might seem to raise issues with the ealier posited orbital velocity around the sample\cite{hirschradiation}.  In the reference's equation 7 it is given as 
\\
$\dfrac{m_e v^2}{r} = \dfrac{qe}{r^2}$
\\
Which gives for the orbital velocity
\\
$v = \sqrt{\dfrac{qe}{r m_e}}$
\\
Hirsch indicated that the above equation may be incorrect in light of the newer spin velocity information\cite{hirschprivvel}.  He does however, identify that the energy consideration expressed in equation 5 of the same document, 
\\
$\dfrac{qe}{r} = 2 m_e c^2$
\\
is still correct.
\\
Additional text on the above for when we need it.  The above expression states that at a critical radius, it will become energetically favorable to produce electron-positron pairs in the sample.
\\
Finally, he points out that the energy expression 4.b. in the same document is of the same order of magnitude of the later corrected expression.  4.b. states, 
\\
$\rho_- = e n_s \left(\dfrac{10}{3}\dfrac{\epsilon}{m_e c^2}\right)^{1/2}$
\\
In a private communication from Hirsch it was also identified that the above expression should be corrected in the following manner.  Using the equation for $\rho_-$ given in the 2008 Ann. Phys. paper\cite{hirschelectrodspin}, and equations 4a. and 5 from the Ionizing radiation paper\cite{hirschradiation} the correct expression for the critical radius mentioned above can be derived.  Here are the starting equations
\\
Eq. for $\rho_-$\cite{hirschelectrodspin}, equation 36.c.
\\
$\rho_- = \dfrac{\hbar c}{16 \pi e \lambda_L^3}$
\\
Eq 4.a. and 5\cite{hirschradiation}
\\
$q = 4 \pi R^2 \lambda_L \rho_-$
\\
$\dfrac{qe}{r} = 2 m_e c^2$
\\
We should be able to solve for $R_c$.  
\\
\section{Proposed Research}
\textbf{List of experiments}
The proposed research will focus on two specific predictions made by the hole theory of superconductivity.  The first prediction is that due to the giant-atom nature of superconducting materials, Bremsstrahlung radiation should be emitted when a superconductor is quenched.  The second is that atoms in the material have a much larger outer orbital due to the kinetic energy lowering of the paired carrier wave functions and that this expanded orbital will change the mean potential of the atom.  The theory predicts changes of a large enough magnitude that they should be detectable by simple electron diffraction techniques.
\\
The x-ray energy predicted by the theory scales linearly with sample radius and is derived by Hirsch\cite{hirschradiation}, (see equation 46), as,
\\
$E = \hbar \omega_m = \dfrac{R}{R_c}m_c c^2$
\\
(insert equation here), while the flux of the radiation scales with the surface area of the sample.  For a spherical sample, the flux scales as the square of the radius of the sample, (insert flux equation here).
