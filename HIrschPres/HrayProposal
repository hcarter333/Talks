\begin{abstract}
The hole theory of supeconductivity was first presented by Hirch and Marsiglio in 1989\cite{hirschfirsthole} as an attempt to explain the mechanism for superconductivity in the, then recently discovered, high temperature superconductors.  In the ensuing twenty-five years, that seminal first article has been cited 191 times and, Hirsch has continued to develop the theory and now posits it as a viable explanation for superconductivity in all superconducting materials.  The proposed research is a series of experimental tests of the theory.  Each of the tests however, will also produce data for previously uncharacterized parameters and dynamic behaviors of bulk superconductors.

\section{Introduction}
To date, there are no reliable methods for predicting where to look for new superconducting materials.  Chapnik met with empirical success in the 1960s and 70s exploring materials with positive Hall coefficients indicating that the intrinsic normal state charge carriers were in fact holes instead of electrons.  After the surprising announcement of high temperature superconducting materials in the 1980s, it was found that conventional BCS theory could not produce successful models for them.  Jorge Hirsch and F. Magliaso proposed a hole pairing model with an associated Hamiltonian based on nearest neighbor hopping potentials.  In addition to providing a plausible model of the superconducting behavior of these new materials, their model also offered a more basic understanding of several superconducting phenomena.  If experimentally verified, this hole pairing model could serve as a jumping off point to guide deterministic searches new superconducting compounds.  It provides a simple, yet rigorous and clear mechanism for many superconducting dynamic behaviors such as the Meissner effect and <add more dynamic predictions>.

The theory provides many testable predictions.  The proposed research will characterize superconducting samples with respect to these theoretical predictions.  Each of the predictions requires making a characterization of bulk superconductor behavior that has not been previously reported.  Consequently, not only will the proposed research produce several experimental tests of the hole theory of superconductivity, it will also contribute previously unmeasured superconductor characteristics to the existing body of knowledge.

\section{Theoretical Background}
The theory of hole sueprconductivity will be developed using the following set of assumptions and logcial scaffolding.  
\\
\\
Assumption: the charged particles forming the paired super-current carriers are in fact holes located near the Fermi level of the sample material, not electrons foudn lower in the band.
\\
\\
As the supercondcutor cools, holes pair, lowering their kinetic energy, consequntly expanding their wavelengths to several 1000 times the size of the unpaired atomic radii.  A convenient model for this behavior can be found in the covalent bond of $H_2$.  A quantitative expression for this expanded radius can be logically deduced\cite{hirschlondondepth}.  Starting with the experimentally verified property of perfect diamagnetism, we can show that the supercarriers must expand to a radius eqivalent to the London penetrtion depth for the material. 
\\
\\

4.  These radii are so large that it is energetically favorable for the paired holes have to align their phases creating coherency on a macroscopic level across the entire superconducting sample.
\\
\\
5.  Add something about how pairs are predicted to be completely destroyed by quenching???
\\
\\
Add a brief explanation of the predictions of the theory.  Here's a question for Dr. Agnolet.  What should an introduction include?  Obviously it can't go too deeply into the theory or it won't be an introductin anymore.  Lok at Andrew's introduction again.
\\
\\
next:  add a few sentences saying what will be discussed in this proposal.
\\
\\
In addition to testing the experimental limits of the hole theory of superconductivity, the proposed research will provide new data for the following four characterizations of superconductor behavior.
\\
1.  The triboelectric effect with regard to sueprconductors.  Hirsch's theory predicts that samples in the superconducting state should fall near the end of the triboelectric scale.  He also points out that there have been no measurements made of the triboelectric properties of superconductors. NOTE: cite Hirsch's paper and the latest PRL triboelectric research.
\\
\\
2.  The presence or absence of electric fields within superconductors.
\\
Hirsch points out\cite{Hirschcap} that while Heinrich London performed an initial experiment on the existance of electric fields within superconductors\cite{londoncap} which returned a null result (todo: add citation), the experiment has never been replicated or refined.  
\\
\\
3.  Determine the mean inner potential of the constiuent atoms of materials in their superconducing state\cite{hirschdifraction}.  The theory of hole superconductivity predicts that the outer orbital of superocnducting atoms should exapd to a radius equal to the London penetration depth for the given material.  This expansion should be visable in electron diffraction measurements.  
\\
\\
4.  Characterization of the photonic radiation from superocnductors when they are quenched.
\\
Each of these characaterizations will be performed for both high termperature and conventional superconducting samples.  The data sets produced are listed in finer detail in the following table.
\\
The purpose of the proposed research is to experimentally test two of the predictions made by the hole theory of superconductivity, that quenched superconductors emit ionizing radiation and that electron diffraction should reveal an increased atomic mean potential due to the expanded outer orbitals of the superconducting atoms.

\section{Review of the Hole Theory of Superconductivity 3 pages at most}
\textbf{Spin and orbital velocity}
\\
There are two different velocties to keeep tracak of in the hole theory of superconductivity  The first is the spin velocity of the supercarriers in their expanded atomic orbitals it is given in terms of angular momentum\cite{hirschspinvel} as
\\
$L = m_e v_\sigma^0 \left(2 \lambda_L\right) = \dfrac{\hbar}{2}$
\\
which gives an intial spin velocity of 
\\
$v_\sigma^0 = \dfrac{\hbar}{4 m_e \lambda_L}$
\\
Note that the spin velocity is independent of the size of the sample and only depends on the London penetraation depth of the material.  This falls out naturally from the derivation above where it was shown that perfrect Larmor diamagnetism implies an expanded supercarrier orbital proportional to the London penetration depth of the material.
\\
\\
This might seem to raise issues with the ealier posited orbital velocity around the sample\cite{hirschradiation}.  In the reference's equation 7 it is given as 
\\
$\dfrac{m_e v^2}{r} = \dfrac{qe}{r^2}$
\\
Which gives for the orbital velocity
\\
$v = \sqrt{\dfrac{qe}{r m_e}}$
\\
Hirsch indicated that the above equation may be incorrect in light of the newer spin velocity information\cite{hirschprivvel}.  He does however, identify that the energy consideration expressed in equation 5 of the same document, 
\\
$\dfrac{qe}{r} = 2 m_e c^2$
\\
is still correct.
\\
Additional text on the above for when we need it.  The above expression states that at a critical radius, it will become energetically favorable to produce electron-positron pairs in the sample.
\\
Finally, he points out that the energy expression 4.b. in the same document is of the same order of magnitude of the later corrected expression.  4.b. states, 
\\
$\rho_- = e n_s \left(\dfrac{10}{3}\dfrac{\epsilon}{m_e c^2}\right)^{1/2}$
\\
In a private communication from Hirsch it was also identified that the above expression should be corrected in the following manner.  Using the equation for $\rho_-$ given in the 2008 Ann. Phys. paper\cite{hirschelectrodspin}, and equations 4a. and 5 from the Ionizing radiation paper\cite{hirschradiation} the correct expression for the critical radius mentioned above can be derived.  Here are the starting equations
\\
Eq. for $\rho_-$\cite{hirschelectrodspin}, equation 36.c.
\\
$\rho_- = \dfrac{\hbar c}{16 \pi e \lambda_L^3}$
\\
Eq 4.a. and 5\cite{hirschradiation}
\\
$q = 4 \pi R^2 \lambda_L \rho_-$
\\
$\dfrac{qe}{r} = 2 m_e c^2$
\\
We should be able to solve for $R_c$.  
\\
\\
\textbf{Hole Theory Hamiltonian}
\\
\\
$t$ is dentoed as the hopping amplitude.  The amplitude as a function of hole density proposed to first order is 
\\
\\
$t\left(n_h\right) = t_h + \Delta t n_h$
\\
\\
where $\Delta t = \dfrac{\partial t}{\partial n_h} > 0$
\\
\\
For the oxides, most of the magnitude of $t$ is from the $\Delta t$ term.  
\\
\\
For neighboring sites we have
\\
\\
$t_{ij} = t_h + \Delta t \left(n_{i,-\sigma}+n_{j,-\sigma}\right)$
\\
\\
This give a kinetic energy of 
\\
\\
$H_{kin} = - \sum_{<jj>, \sigma} t_{ij}\left(c^+_{i\sigma}c_{j\sigma} + h.c.\right) = -\sum_{<jj>, \sigma}\left(t_h + \Delta t \left(n_{i,-\sigma} + n_{j,-\sigma}\right)\right)\left(c^+_{i\sigma}c_{j\sigma} + h.c.\right)$
\\
\\
Where $t_{ij}$ is the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude.
\\
\\
\textbf{Question}: Why is the last term of the above Hamiltonian taken as the potential when it's just a re-expression of the kinetic energy, (at least that's what equation 4 was stated to be.)  Is it because it's position dependent?
\\
\\
\textbf{Answer}: The article doesn't say it is a potential, it merely says that by extending the Hamiltonian as it is above, you can see where the interaction terms comes from and that it is
\\
\\
$V_h = -\Delta t\sum_{<jj>, \sigma}\left( \left(n_{i,-\sigma} + n_{j,-\sigma}\right)\right)\left(c^+_{i\sigma}c_{j\sigma} + h.c.\right)$
\\
\\
Equation 5, for $V_h$ is the hopping interaction.  It seems like what we're saying is that if we can make the potential less negtaive, then we make it less repulsive.  That apparently is not the cae though.  If you can make the potential more negaitve, then it is more attractive.
\\
\\
The Hamiltonian above 'leads to pairing with arbitrarily short coherence length'.  With $t_h = 0$, two holes will propagate only if they are nearest neighbors.  This gives a coherence lenght of less than a single lattice spacing.
\\
\\
The next step is to copare this to a Hubbard odel with $U < 0$.  "This is widely used as a paradigm for short coherence length superconductors."  In this model, short coherence length occurs for small $t$ or large $U$.  This is all about equation 6 in the article.  However, in this regime the mobility of the pairs becomes very small, so it doesn't seem useful for superconductors with pairs.  
\\
\\
There's another problem, in the attractive Hubbard model, ($U < 0$?), the binding energy increases relative to the effective hopping as the coherence lengthbecomes shorter  in equation 7, 
\\
\\
$t_{eff} = \dfrac{t^2}{|U|}$
\\
\\
So, under the above conditions?  we have 
\\
\\
$E_b >> t_{eff}$
\\
\\
Here we clear up how this compares to the Hubbard model and how the model, RVB, proposed by Anderson.  
\\
\\
Equation 15 which Hirsch cites seems to belie my assumption however.  It says that the potential is the least repuslive for the largest energy, which makes the expression return the largest negative number.
\\
\\
\section{Proposed Research}
\textbf{List of experiments}
The proposed research will focus on two specific predictions made by the hole theory of superconductivity.  The first prediction is that due to the giant-atom nature of superconducting materials, Bremsstrahlung radiation should be emitted when a superconductor is quenched.  The second is that atoms in the material have a much larger outer orbital due to the kinetic energy lowering of the paired carrier wave functions and that this expanded orbital will change the mean potential of the atom.  The theory predicts changes of a large enough magnitude that they should be detectable by simple electron diffraction techniques.
\\
The x-ray energy predicted by the theory scales linearly with sample radius and is derived by Hirsch\cite{hirschradiation}, (see equation 46), as,
\\
$E = \hbar \omega_m = \dfrac{R}{R_c}m_c c^2$
\\
(insert equation here), while the flux of the radiation scales with the surface area of the sample.  For a spherical sample, the flux scales as the square of the radius of the sample, (insert flux equation here).
