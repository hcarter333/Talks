\begin{abstract}
This brief note  presents an updated version of DeSilva's can crusher simulator, whose results were first published 20 years ago in conjunction with the design of an associated laboratory demonstration.  The original simulator has been updated from IDL to Python running in the SageMath framework and open-sourced.  The code has also been re-structured into an object oriented architecture that allows for simple input of can crusher solenoid parameters.  This allows multiple solenoids with varying configurations to be simulated and compared.  We describe the facilities the updated simulator provides, along with the basics of its use.  While we're using the simulator to design apparatus for the study of bulk properties of superconducators, it can also be used in conjunction with a can crusher apparatus as part of an interactive demonstration laboratory.

% Section numbering is automatic.

Wherein we define the Thomas precession.  Mention what it is and what it isn't, especially for the purposes of this article.  For example, we don't have a finite gyroscope like the most recent EJP article on it, (although that's nice that it works).  This is also not an article about how an actual gyroscope might precess about the axis of its rotation.  Point out that this is acceptable, and that while the oft-referenced Russian history article claims Missner, Thorne, and Wheeler were wrong, they weren't.  However, we won't be discussing it here.  We're using the idealized gyro-compass described by Rindler on his article regarding rotating cooordinate frames, and general relativity.  Be sure to reference Rindler.

Reference Munoz and Yoshida as having derived rotating versions of the Lalace-Runge-Lenz vector.  Reference Sommerfeld's incredibly simple derivation that the perihelion advance as Thomas precession will come from.  

Refernce the disc problem, Takeno, Thomas, and the perhaps one other person in that historical line.  Look at the Iranian paper to find the other person.  Reference the Iranian paper.

\section{Thomas Precession as Perihelion Advance}
Reference the "Two Circular Exmaples" AJP paper as pointing out that the coordinate system of the travelling observer has rotated.  Link this to Somerfeld's offhanded comment on the rotating coordinate system of the perihelion advance.

\section{Thomas Precession and Karpetoff Takeno Coordinates}
Our second derivation hinges upon three simple tricks. Two of them are things that we often mention in freshman physics lecture, but rarely back up until upper level classes.  First, special relativity only cares aobut the direction of motion, queue up the endless lectures on the relativistic ladder problem.  Second, a clever choice of coordinate system can make turn derivation hell into derivation heaven.  The third trick has lurked in the shadows since Alfred Dobbs first coined the phrase rapidity, but it wasn't properly discovered until Antippa \cite{antipparapid} pointed it out.  While Antippa's presentation was deep, it was perhaps too deep.  The trick labored in the shadows for another year before kapuscik\cite{kapuscikrapid} uttered the famous phrase regarding its use'...we may \textit{relate all velocity dependent relativistic physical quantities to the corresponding non-relativistic quantities}.'  The italics are Kaspuscik's because, it's just that important.  Still, a concrete example with feeling wouldn't be seen for another seven years in the work of Walter\cite{wlaterrapid}.  As a side note, he was apparently unaware of Antippa's foundational work in the field.

The aspect of third trick that we will exploit can be summed up in a nutshell; if you have a Galilean velocity solution to a one dimensional mechanics problem, it can be used directly as a rapidity to produce the same result in special relativity.  Let's look at a brief, but rather impressive example of this.  As late as the 2001 edition of Goldstein, students are still implored to first re-write the rocket equation of motion to account for relativistic mass effects and then solve for lab frame velocities.  However, we can use the Galilean solution for the same problem
\\
\\
$v = $
\\
\\
and simply plug it in as the rapidity $w$ in the following expression for lab frame velocity
\\
\\
$\dfrac{v}{c} = tanh\left(\dfrac{w}{c}\right)$
\\
\\
A little bit of algebraic wrangling will produce Goldstein's result with far less effort,
\\
\\
$v = $
\\
\\
Wait... what!?  As it turns out, all those vignette's on adding velocities in special relativity using rapidity and the hyperbolic tangent addition of angle formula didn't go nearly as far as they could have.  There are two simple proofs of the method.  Ours considers an incremental velocity while Walter's integrates to produce what he tems the 'proper speed'.

Here, we show that the precession can be derived as a one dimensional expression.  There's no requirement to approximate angles, as in "two circles", or use infintesimal boosts in different directcions, or do whatever they did in "half page derviation" that took two pages.  Outline the history of the Rapidity as Galilean tranform solution, expalining the three locations it lighted in before being actually demonstrated as useful.  Give a brief derivation that jutifies the method and then show the Goldtsein rocket derviation just for funsies.  Finally, using the Karapetoff Lorentz transform, show the Thomas precession in a few lines.
\\
\\
\section{Conclusions}
We have demonstrated two new derivations of the innocuous Thomas Precession.  The ease with which tese derviations can be demonstrated frees up more time for in-class discussions of whta the Thomas precession actually is.
