\begin{abstract}
This brief note  presents an updated version of DeSilva's can crusher simulator, whose results were first published 20 years ago in conjunction with the design of an associated laboratory demonstration.  The original simulator has been updated from IDL to Python running in the SageMath framework and open-sourced.  The code has also been re-structured into an object oriented architecture that allows for simple input of can crusher solenoid parameters.  This allows multiple solenoids with varying configurations to be simulated and compared.  We describe the facilities the updated simulator provides, along with the basics of its use.  While we're using the simulator to design apparatus for the study of bulk properties of superconducators, it can also be used in conjunction with a can crusher apparatus as part of an interactive demonstration laboratory.

\section{Introduction} % Section titles are automatically converted to all-caps.
% Section numbering is automatic.

Wherein we define the Thomas precession.  Mention what it is and what it isn't, especially for the purposes of this article.  For example, we don't have a finite gyroscope like the most recent EJP article on it, (although that's nice that it works).  This is also not an article about how an actual gyroscope might precess about the axis of its rotation.  Point out that this is acceptable, and that while the oft-referenced Russian history article claims Missner, Thorne, and Wheeler were wrong, they weren't.  However, we won't be discussing it here.  We're using the idealized gyro-compass described by Rindler on his article regarding rotating cooordinate frames, and general relativity.  Be sure to reference Rindler.

Reference Munoz and Yoshida as having derived rotating versions of the Lalace-Runge-Lenz vector.  Reference Sommerfeld's incredibly simple derivation that the perihelion advance as Thomas precession will come from.  

Refernce the disc problem, Takeno, Thomas, and the perhaps one other person in that historical line.  Look at the Iranian paper to find the other person.  Reference the Iranian paper.

\section{Language Port and Architecture}
While IDL is still a ubiquitous language, and a free version known as GDL can be installed on Linux platforms, we decided to port the code to Python executed within the SageMath platform.  Our team is familiar with Python, and with the advent of packages like NumPy and SciPy, the language is gaining a certain noteriety with young physicists.  SageMath has a cloud based implementation that has been funded by the National Science Foundation and Google. The user interface of this cloud-based software implementation is accessible to the public through any web browser.  Consequently, anyone can make use of the SageMath platform and the ported simulator on any operating system that supports a web browser.  There are no operating system or software installation considerations to be made.
\\
\\
In addition to the language port, we re-architected the simulator to be object oriented.  While only the most rudimentary object architected structure has been put in place, it has already allowed us to simulate different solenoid parameters and their pertinence to our research with ease.  The basic object in the simulator is a member of the Crusher class.  Each Crusher object has its own set of parameters that fully describe a can crusher apparatus design configuration.  Among these configurable parameters  are the radius and the number of coils in the solenoid, the temperature sensitive resistivity of the solenoid, and the temperature of the solenoid's operating environment.  As a concrete example, the following code sets up the Crusher object with a solenoid radius of $3.8\;\;cm$, an initial power supply voltage of $5000\;\;Volts$, and an operating temperature of $4.2\;\;degrees\;\;K$.  the set\_movecan method tells the Crusher object that we're simulating pulsing the magnetic field with a solid core in the solenoid's center, rather than a compressible soda can.

\section{Example Simulator Applications}
We created simulations that answered many questions about our experimental design without the expense of building and testing different pulsed magnetic solenoids.  Some concrete examples of these questions are:

\section{Conclusions}
We have demonstrated two new derivations of the innocuous Thomas Precession.  The ease with which tese derviations can be demonstrated frees up more time for in-class discussions of whta the Thomas precession actually is.
